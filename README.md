# 09-ShadowFlapGame-Java-2021

This is my first Java project, and also my first object oriented project. I wrote the Game flappy bird, but I have added some other functionalities, such as:
1. Level up when reaches amount of scores
2. New level allowing player to control the flying speed
3. New level allowing user to use weapon: bomb and rock
4. New level normal tube can be cracked by rock and bomb
5. New level added a new type of tube: Iron tube, which can flame fire, and can only be cracked by bomb
